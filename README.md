Semantic HTML Elements
The source code utilises semantic HTML elements, improving website accessibility and improving the overall layout of source code, allowing for easier website maintenance through easier comprehension of structure and content.  

Logical Structure of HTML Elements
The logical structuring of HTML elements, independent of styling and positioning ensures easier navigation, alongside ease of website maintenance and future upgrades. 

Alt Attributes for Image Elements
Alt attributes have been added to image elements, allowing users who rely on screen readers or are image disabled to understand the purpose and content encapsulated within the images. 

Sequential Order of Heading Attributes
The heading atributes within this webpage follow a sequential order, further enhancing the flow of content. This allows for a smoother reading experience, whilst also improving the experience of webpage maintenance.

Removal of Unnecessary CSS
The CSS for the webpage has been carefully examined, and any extra CSS code has been eliminated. The page loads faster thanks to this optimisation method, which also makes sure that only necessary styles are used, allowing for easier website maintenance.

Consolidation of CSS into Singular Classes and Units
The CSS code has been streamlined into single classes and units when appropriate, minimising code duplication and enhancing maintainability. This strategy simplifies the CSS and encourages uniformity across the webpage, also improving the process of website maintenance and future upgrades.
